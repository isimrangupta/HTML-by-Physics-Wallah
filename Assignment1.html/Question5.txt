5. Compare and contrast a text editor and an IDE, highlighting their key features and uses?

(1) Text editor:
A text editor is a software tool used for creating and editing plain text files, such as code files. It provides basic functionalities for modifying and saving text. 
Exmple:-If you need to write code or edit existing code, you can use text editors like Sublime Text or Atom.

  Features of a text editor:-

(a) Syntax Highlighting = Color-coding of different elements in the code (such as keywords, variables, and functions) to improve readability and help you understand the structure of the code more easily.

(b) Code Completion = Provides suggestions and automatically completes code snippets, functions, and variables as you type, which speeds up coding and reduces errors.

(c) Find and Replace = Allows you to search for specific text within the file and replace it with desired content. This is useful for making bulk changes.

(d) Customization = You can adjust themes, preferences, and install plugins to personalize the editing environment according to your needs.

(e) Lightweight =  Text editors are generally lightweight, meaning they run quickly and use fewer system resources compared to more complex software.

(f) Basic Debugging = Text editors usually offer limited or no built-in debugging capabilities. They are mainly used for editing text and code, not for debugging.

Conclusion: A text editor is a simple and lightweight tool that provides basic features for creating and editing text and code.

(2) Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE is a comprehensive software suite that combines a text editor with additional tools and features. It is designed to simplify software development by providing an all-in-one environment where you can write, test, debug, and deploy code.
Examples: VS Code.


Features of an IDE :--
(a) Advanced Editing Capabilities = IDE have features like syntax highlighting (color-coding code elements), code completion (suggestions while typing), and code formatting. These make writing and reading code easier.

(b) ntegrated Compiler and Debugger = IDE include tools to compile (convert code into a working program) and debug (find and fix errors). This means you can fix problems directly in the IDE.

(c) Project Management = IDEs help organize and manage your project. They offer tools for navigating files, integrating version control systems like Git, and supporting build processes.

(d) Language-Specific Tools = IDE often have tools designed for specific programming languages. These can include features like code refactoring (improving code structure), templates, and documentation.

(e) Integrated Testing = IDE provide tools for testing your code. This includes unit testing (checking small parts of code), automated testing, and analyzing test results to ensure your code works as expected.

(f) Profiling and Performance Analysis = IDE can profile (analyze) your code to find performance issues, such as slow parts of the code. This helps in making your code more efficient.

(g) Extensibility = Many IDE support plugins and extensions that add new features and support for additional languages or frameworks.

Conclusion: An IDE is an advanced tool that offers not only text editing but also features for code writing, testing, debugging, and deployment. It helps manage the development process in one place.
