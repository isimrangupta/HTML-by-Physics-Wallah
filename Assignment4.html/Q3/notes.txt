3. Define accessibility in the context of web development. Discuss why it's essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different user groups?


Accessibility in Web Development:-
Accessibility means designing and developing websites in such a way that they are usable by everyone, including those with disabilities. It ensures that everyone has equal access to information and services.

Why to Use Accessibility:-
(a) Legal compliance (e.g., ADA, WCAG).
(b)Inclusivity and social responsibility.
(c)Expands audience reach.
(d)Improves SEO.
(e)Benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.

Benefits to Different User Groups:-

(a) Use Semantic HTML Tags: Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` make the content structure clear and are helpful for screen readers. These tags help assistive technologies understand the purpose of the content.

(b) Provide Alt Text for Images: Alt text provides a description of images, which helps users with visual impairments understand the context. It is also used when the image cannot be loaded.

(c)Ensure Keyboard Navigability: Many users navigate using a keyboard, so it is important to ensure that the site is accessible via the keyboard. This makes it easier for users to navigate form fields, buttons, and links.

(d)Use ARIA Landmarks: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks help assistive technologies understand the content structure and functionality. They assist users in navigating the website.

(e)Test with Screen Readers and Other Assistive Technologies: Testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies ensures that the site is accessible to everyone. This testing helps understand the real-world experience of users.
